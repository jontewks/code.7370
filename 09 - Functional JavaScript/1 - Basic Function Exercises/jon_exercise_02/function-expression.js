// There are a few ways to create functions in JavaScript. The first way we will be
// going over is called function expression. A function expression is simply creating
// a variable, just like we have in the past, but instead of assigning a value to it,
// we assign a function to it. Take a look at the following example:

// var sayHello = function () {
//   console.log('Hello!');
// };

// In that example, we are creating the variable "sayHello" and then assigning a function
// to the variable so that if someone were to write the following code:
// sayHello();
// Then our function would run, and would console.log "Hello!".

// On the lines below, use function expression to create a function that can do whatever
// you would like it to.


// Now that you have some experience with function expressions, lets write another function
// expression, but this function should take some arguments! Here is a quick example for
// reference later on:

// var sayHelloTo = function (name) {
//   console.log('Hello', name);
// };

// Inside those parentheses is where we can specify how many arguments our function
// expects. On the lines below, write a function expression that expects to take more
// than one argument.
