// Below we have the name of a function that we are going to pretend exists:
// addNumbersTogether

// But if we ran the code as it is if it were uncommented, it wouldn't work right. That's
// because we haven't invoked the function yet, or told the computer to run the function's
// code. What change do we need to make to the function in order to invoke it? Write the
// new code with that change below:


// Now that we have invoked the function, it appears that we need to pass the function
// some arguments. Arguments are what we give a funciton in order for it to work correctly.
// Lets pretend that we need to give the function two arguments, both numbers, for it to add.
// On the lines below, write what that might look like:


// Now lets pretend it can take as many arguments as we want. On the lines below, write
// what it would look like if we were to give the function 4 numbers to add together.


// Above, we were passing numbers in to a function as arguments, but did you know that a
// function can take any type of object as an argument? This means we can pass strings,
// numbers, floats, arrays, objects, variables, or other functions as arguments.
// On the lines below, modify the function call so that we pass in a string as the first
// and only argument.

// thisFunctionExpectsAString()


// Now lets try it with a few different types of objects:

// thisFunctionExpectsAnArray()
// thisFunctionExpectsAnObject()
// thisFunctionExpectsAVariable()


// Now that you see you can pass any type of object into a function as an argument, lets
// combine that ability with the ability to pass in multiple arguments into the same function.
// The function below is expecting two arrays as arguments, lets give them to it!

// combineArrays()
