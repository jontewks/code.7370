// In the previous exercises, we briefly went over how to define arrays.
// Defining a variable and storing an empty array in it looks like this:
// var array = [];

// If you want to store some data to access later in the array, you simply
// enter each peice of data in the array separated by commas, like this:
// var numbers = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5];

// On the line below, define an empty array called "emptyArray".


// On the line below, define an array called "lettersArray", and add
// some letters in it. (Remember since these letters need to be strings,
// we need to wrap them in quotation marks; i.e. 'a', 'b')


// Arrays can hold any type of object in them, even other variables!
// Storing variables as items in an array would look like this:
// var array = [var1, var2, var3];

// On the line below, define a variable called "number" and store any number
// you want. Then define a variable called "numberArray" and store the variable
// "number" that you just created in the "numberArray"
