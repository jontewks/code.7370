// Now that we can create arrays and store data in them, we need to know how
// to access that data later on when we want to use it.

// You can access information held in arrays through "indexes". An index is
// the number position in the array that the data you are looking for is held at.
// Arrays are 0 indexed based, meaning the index of the very first item in the
// array is at index 0, the second item in the array is at index 1, and so on.

// You access data held in arrays by their indexes using square brackets "[" and "]".
// If we had an array and wanted to get the first item in it, that would look like this:
// var array = [1, 3, 4, 10];
// array[0]
// If we wanted to get the fourth item, it would look like this:
// array[3]

// On the lines below we have an array. We want to get the third item in the array,
// so on the line below the array, access the third item
var array = ['Jon', 5, 9.9, 'hello world']


// On the lines below this, define a variable with an array containing any values you
// would like. Then below that, start accessing those values in any order. Keep
// playing with different indexes and seeing what comes back to get a better
// understanding of how the 0 based indicies of arrays work.


// One very important property that all arrays come with automatically is their length.
// Knowing the length of an array can be very helpful when working with it. We can find
// out the length of the array by doing the following:
// var array = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]
// array.length

// You can check the length property on any array you have created or any array you
// come accross. On the lines below, create an array and check the length property of it.
// Then add a few items and check the length property again. JavaScript automatically
// keeps that property up to date so you will always know how many items the array holds.
// (As a side note, you can also check the length property on strings as well!)
