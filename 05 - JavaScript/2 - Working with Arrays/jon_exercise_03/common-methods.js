// Write the JavaScript code to add several properties to the array using 'push' and 'unshift' methods.
// Write the JavaScript code to remove several properties from the array using 'pop' and 'shift' methods.

// Arrays also come with a few common methods to make working with them easier.

// The method push will add a value we give it to the end of an array:
// var array = [];
// array.push(1);

// After doing the above, our array would now look like this:
// [1]

// We can continue to push values onto it like:
// array.push('hello');
// array.push(9);

// Now our array would look like this:
// [1, 'hello', 9]

// Anything you can store in an array, you can put between the parentheses after push
// and it will be added to the end of the array. On the lines below, create an array
// and use the push method a few different times to store different values in the array.
// Periodically console.log the array to see how it has been changing.
