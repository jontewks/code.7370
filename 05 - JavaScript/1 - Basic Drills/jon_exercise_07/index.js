// Lets do another common math operation.
//
// If we wanted to define a variable called "subtraction" and store the
// result of the mathematical operation 10 - 5, it would look like this:
// var subtraction = 10 - 5;
//
// On the line below, define a variable named "mySubtraction" and store
// the result of 6 - 3.
