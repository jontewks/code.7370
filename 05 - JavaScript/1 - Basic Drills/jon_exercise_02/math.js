// Computers are really good at doing mathematical operations. We can
// ask the computer to do the operation for us to see the result, but we
// can also store the results in variables. Lets do a few basic math operations.
//
// If we wanted to define a variable called "addition" and store the
// result of the mathematical operation 2 + 2, it would look like this:
// var addition = 2 + 2;
// If we just wanted to see the result of the operation, we would do this:
// console.log(2 + 2)
// Console.log prints out the result of what we give to it to the console for us
// to see.
//
// On the line below, define a variable named "myAddition" and store
// the result of 5 + 5.


// If we wanted to define a variable called "subtraction" and store the
// result of the mathematical operation 10 - 5, it would look like this:
// var subtraction = 10 - 5;
//
// On the line below, define a variable named "mySubtraction" and store
// the result of 6 - 3.


// If we wanted to define a variable called "multiplication" and store the
// result of the mathematical operation 3 * 2, it would look like this:
// var multiplication = 3 * 2;
//
// On the line below, define a variable named "myMultiplication" and store
// the result of 3 * 3.


// The last common math operation is division.
//
// If we wanted to define a variable called "division" and store the
// result of the mathematical operation 10 / 5, it would look like this:
// var division = 10 / 5;
//
// On the line below, define a variable named "myDivision" and store
// the result of 15 / 3.
