// Variables can also store values called "strings". Strings are anything
// between quotation marks.
//
// If we wanted to create a variable named "myName" and store the value
// "Jon" in it, it would look like this:
// var myName = 'Jon';
//
// As a side note, both the double (") and single (') quotation marks will
// work when creating strings.
//
// On the line below, define a variable with the name "myString" and
// store the value "dog".
