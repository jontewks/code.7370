// We also use variables to store a type of value called an object.
//
// If we wanted to store an empty object in the variable "emptyObject",
// it would look like this:
// var emptyObject = {};
//
// On the line below, define a variable named "myObject" and store an
// empty object within it.


// Data is held inside of objects as key-value pairs. If we wanted to
// define a variable named "info" as an object with the key "name", and
// the value "Jon", it would look like the following:
// var info = {
//   name: 'Jon'
// };
//
// On the line below, define a variable named "myObject", but this time,
// we are going to store the key age, and the value 28.
