// There are also some operations that can be applied to Boolean values. They are
// called logical operators. JavaScript supports three logical operators: and, or,
// and not.
//
// The && operator represents and. Its result is true only if both the
// values given to it are true:
// true && false will return false
// true && true will return true
//
// The || operator denotes or. It produces true if either of the values
// given to it is true:
// false || true will return true
// false || false will return false
//
// Not is written as an exclamation mark (!). It flips the value given to it.
// !true produces false and !false gives true.
//
// For each of the three logical operators, write an operation that evaluates
// to true and an operation that evaluates to false.
