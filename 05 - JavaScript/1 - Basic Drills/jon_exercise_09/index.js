// The last common math operation is division.
//
// If we wanted to define a variable called "division" and store the
// result of the mathematical operation 10 / 5, it would look like this:
// var division = 10 / 5;
//
// On the line below, define a variable named "myDivision" and store
// the result of 15 / 3.
