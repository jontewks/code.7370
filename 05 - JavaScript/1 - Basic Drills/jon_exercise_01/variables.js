// Variables can store all different types of values. Below we are going to
// use variables to store information we will want to access later.
//
// Variable definition in JavaScript looks like the following:
// var variableName = thingToStore;
//
// So if we wanted to create a variable named "theNumber100" and store the
// value 100, it would look like this:
// var theNumber100 = 100;
//
// Now it's your turn. On the line below, define a variable with the name
// "myNumber" and store the value 10.


// Variables can also store values called "strings". Strings are anything
// between quotation marks.
//
// If we wanted to create a variable named "myName" and store the value
// "Jon" in it, it would look like this:
// var myName = 'Jon';
//
// As a side note, both the double (") and single (') quotation marks will
// work when creating strings.
//
// On the line below, define a variable with the name "myString" and
// store the value "dog".


// Another type of value that variables can store is an array. An array is
// a list of values stored in a single variable. Arrays can hold any type
// of value in them.
//
// If we wanted to creat a variable named "emptyArray" and store an array
// in it that was empty, it would look like this:
// var emptyArray = [];
//
// On the line below, define a variable named "myArray" and store an empty
// array in it.


// Values in arrays are separated by commas, so if we wanted to store the
// values 1, 2, and 3 in an array called "numbers", it would look like this:
// var numbers = [1, 2, 3];
//
// On the line below, define a variable named "myNumbers" and store an array
// with the numbers 5, 10, and 15.


// We also use variables to store a type of value called an object.
//
// If we wanted to store an empty object in the variable "emptyObject",
// it would look like this:
// var emptyObject = {};
//
// On the line below, define a variable named "myObject" and store an
// empty object within it.


// Data is held inside of objects as key-value pairs. If we wanted to
// define a variable named "info" as an object with the key "name", and
// the value "Jon", it would look like the following:
// var info = {
//   name: 'Jon'
// };
//
// On the line below, define a variable named "myObject", but this time,
// we are going to store the key age, and the value 28.


// We also use variables to store values called booleans.
//
// Booleans are simply the value true or false. If we wanted to define
// a variable named "truth" and store the boolean value true, it would
// look like this:
// var truth = true;
//
// On the line below, define a variable named "lie" and store
// the boolean false.
