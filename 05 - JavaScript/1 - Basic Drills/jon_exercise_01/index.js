// Variables can store all different types of values. Below we are going to
// use variables to store information we will want to access later.
//
// Variable definition in JavaScript looks like the following:
// var variableName = thingToStore;
//
// So if we wanted to create a variable named "theNumber100" and store the
// value 100, it would look like this:
// var theNumber100 = 100;
//
// Now it's your turn. On the line below, define a variable with the name
// "myNumber" and store the value 10.
