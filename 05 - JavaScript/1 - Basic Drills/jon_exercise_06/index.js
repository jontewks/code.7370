// Computers are really good at doing mathematical operations. We can
// ask the computer to do the operation for us to see the result, but we
// can also store the results in variables. Lets do a few basic math operations.
//
// If we wanted to define a variable called "addition" and store the
// result of the mathematical operation 2 + 2, it would look like this:
// var addition = 2 + 2;
//
// On the line below, define a variable named "myAddition" and store
// the result of 5 + 5.
