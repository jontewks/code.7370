// Lets do another common math operation.
//
// If we wanted to define a variable called "multiplication" and store the
// result of the mathematical operation 3 * 2, it would look like this:
// var multiplication = 3 * 2;
//
// On the line below, define a variable named "myMultiplication" and store
// the result of 3 * 3.
