// Now that we know how to do math operations, we need to learn how to compare
// numbers with one another.
//
// The basic comparisons are less than (<), greater than (>), equal to (===),
// not equal to (!==), less than or equal to (<=), and greater than or equal to (>=).
//
// We use the symbols in between the parentheses with numbers, or variables that
// store numbers on each side. If we wanted to see if the number 5 was less than
// the number 10, we would do it as follows:
// 5 < 10
// In this case, JavaScript will return true, as 5 is less than 10. JavaScript will
// always return a boolean (true or false) when you do a comparision.
//
// On the line below, define a variable named "myTrueComparison" and perform any
// comparison you want that will evaluate to true.


// On the line below, define a variable named "myFalseComparison" and perform any
// comparison you want that will evaluate to false. Use a different type of comparison
// than you used for the true one.


// Try a few more using any of the comparisons that you haven't used yet.
