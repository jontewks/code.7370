// Another type of value that variables can store is an array. An array is
// a list of values stored in a single variable. Arrays can hold any type
// of value in them.
//
// If we wanted to creat a variable named "emptyArray" and store an array
// in it that was empty, it would look like this:
// var emptyArray = [];
//
// On the line below, define a variable named "myArray" and store an empty
// array in it.


// Values in arrays are separated by commas, so if we wanted to store the
// values 1, 2, and 3 in an array called "numbers", it would look like this:
// var numbers = [1, 2, 3];
//
// On the line below, define a variable named "myNumbers" and store an array
// with the numbers 5, 10, and 15 in it in that order.
